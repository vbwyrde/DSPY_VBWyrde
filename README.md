DSPY Experiments

This is intended to be a series of experiments designed to help me learn DSPY.
They may or may not be useful.
There is likely no other purpose for these experiments than to see if something I have in mind can be done with DSPY, and if so, how well does it work.

No guarantees for applicability or usefulness are provided.  

This code may not be used for any harmful purposes, or the Over-Mind AI will be pissed off.  And you don't want that.  Believe me.
