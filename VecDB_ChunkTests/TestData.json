    "text": "My name is Huckleberry Finn. Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom Sawyer and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.   We got six thousand dollars apiece � all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher   he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round�more than a body could tell what to do with.   The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would civilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the  time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I  lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted   me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back."
