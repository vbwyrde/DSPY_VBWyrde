# DSPY12.py OUTPUT
This is the output of DSPY12.py ... note: a good deal of the output here are print statements to help trace the script's operations.  If / when I get to a final version, it will remove most of the print statements you see here. 

## DSPY12.py Features

- Imports several libraries including dspy, transformers, importlib, subprocess, ast, and traceback.

- Initializes a connection to a large language model (LLM) called MyLM through the dspy library.

- Defines a class called MultiHop that inherits from the dspy.Module class. This class is designed to answer questions in a multi-hop fashion by combining retrieval and reasoning steps.

- Defines a class called GenerateTasks that inherits from the dspy.Signature class. This class is designed to generate a list of tasks from a given context and question.

- Defines a function called DoesImportModuleExist that checks if all the required modules are installed for the provided code. If not, it asks the user if they want to install them.

- Defines a function called validate_python_code_ast that validates the Python code using the ast library.

- Defines a function called ValidateCodeMatchesTask that checks if the generated code fulfills all the requirements specified in the task list.

- Defines a function called run_code that executes the provided Python code.

- Defines a function called run_python_code that compiles and executes the provided Python code after performing safety checks such as AST validation.

- Defines a function called process_generated_code that cleans the generated code.

- Defines a recursive function called GenCode that generates Python code to fulfill a given task by interacting with the MyLM model.

- Defines a class called Main that takes a context and question as input and executes the entire program flow. This includes generating tasks, generating code, validating the code, and finally running the code.
